    <h2>TV Streaming</h2>
    <p>This is a web application for streaming the TV signal from my home.</p>
    <p>I'm using an Odroid computer as a server, and a Capture card to get the video signal from my set-up box. I also created a remote control using an IR LED, and the GPIO connectors of the Odroid computer. I hope that you enjoy watching!</p>
